## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a multi-disciplinary AI Engineer dedicated to moving beyond simple chatbots. I specialize in building **autonomous systems** that reason, self-correct, and scale. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex research and reliable, human-in-the-loop applications.

- 🔭 Currently working on: **Agentic RAG for ITSM Automation**
- 🌱 Learning: **Knowledge Graphs (Neo4j) & LLMOps**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe the best AI systems are built on clean data, not just big models.
